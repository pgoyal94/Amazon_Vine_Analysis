# Amazon Vine Analysis
Analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.

## Overview of the analysis: 
We are helping a company that is about to release a large amount of products to a website. They want to know how the reviews of their products compare to the reviews of similar products sold by their competitors. They are also interested in enrolling in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers, but want to know if it is worth it.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
